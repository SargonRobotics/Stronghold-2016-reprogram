# Stronghold-2016-reprogram
Reprogrammed version of our 2016 code, way more organized

The code we used during season was an iterative based program, it was also a huge mess.
This was made using the command based structure, we reprogrammed our 2016 robot to learn how this structure works.

Needless to say it works quite well, and as you may be able to tell in contrast to our original 2016 repo: it's way more organized.
